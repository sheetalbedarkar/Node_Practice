Template literals are String literals allowing embedded expression.
Template literals are enclosed by the backtick (``) character instead of double or single quote.
Template literals can contain placeholders. These are indicated by the dollar sign and curly braces (${expression})
The expression in the placeholders and the expression between backtick (``) get passed to a function.
